# MUI-Demo-App-Finance

Web app implementing the MUI React Component Library.

Simple project to practice creating a React app using the MUI provided UI component library. The app has 3 pages:

    Dashboard page to view the last year's financial spending
    Transactions page to view transactions by month for both credit card and savings accounts
    Payments page to request and accept payments as well as view contacts and recent payments

Future developments to include analytics and budgeting pages.
